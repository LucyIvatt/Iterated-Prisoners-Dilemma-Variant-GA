    "## Design - Agent Representation\n",
    "\n",
    "To begin with, each agent needs to be able to encode and store an evolvable strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining an agents memory, there are $n^{2m}$ possible cases, where n is the number of societies types and m is the number of games each agent is allowed to remember. In this proposed solution, each agent will have a memory of 1 match, therefore there are $4^2=16$ possibilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "The encoded strategy is simply a rule which specifies the action the agent should take in each of these 16 cases. In the context of this problem, the action to take is defined as the society the agent should switch to.\n",
    "\n",
    " An example subsection of this strategy is shown in the table below. \n",
    "\n",
    "| Memory              | Strategy (Society to switch to)       |\n",
    "| ------------------  | ------------------------------------  |\n",
    "| (Saint, Saint)      | Buddy                                 |\n",
    "| (Saint, Buddy)      | Vandal                                |\n",
    "| (Saint, Fight Club) | Saint                                 |\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This strategy can be expressed compactly as a list of length $4^2$ (e.g. `[Buddy, Vandal, Saint, Saint, ..., Fight Club]`). Therefore each agent must be able to find the index for the chromosome from the remembered match pairing.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rather than generating a lookup table which maps society pairings to chromosome indexes, e.g. `{(Saint, Saint) = 0, (Saint, Buddy) = 1, ... (Vandal, Vandal) = 15}`, a faster method which also uses less memory is to map each society to a number between 0 and 3 and use the base 4 integer value of the pairing to access the chomosome. For example, with the assignments `{Saints: 0, Buddies: 1, Fight Club: 2, Vandals: 3}` the following indexes are obtained.\n",
    "\n",
    "- (Saint, Saint) = $00_4$ maps to index 0\n",
    "- (Saint, Buddy) = $01_4$ maps to index 1\n",
    "- (Saint, Fight Club) = $02_4$ maps to index 2\n",
    "- ...\n",
    "- (Vandal, Vandal) = $33_4$ maps to index 15\n",
    "\n",
    "**Summary**\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, each agent will have a memory of 1 match, a pairing of the agents current faction and the opponent's faction. The base 4 representation of this matching will be used as the index to access the agents chromosome/strategy. This is represented as list of length 16 where each gene represents a society to switch to. \n"

    "### Evaluation & Fitness\n",
    "For every generation of the algorithm, including the first population, all agents needs to be evaluated to determine their fitness. \n",
    "\n",
    "For $N$ rounds, two agents are randomly selected and play each other. Each time agents play each other, their `rounds_played` attribute is incremented by 1, their `total_score` is increased by the relevant payoff, and they both change society depending on their chromosomes value for that matchup of societies.\n",

As the game selects the agents who play each round completely randomly, there is likely to be an unfair difference between the total wealths of each agent. For example, an agent who has played 1 round and has a wealth of 6, should not have the same fitness as an agent who has played 6 rounds and also has a wealth of 6. \n",
